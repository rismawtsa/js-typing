# Js (Just) Typing

Just Typing is not a game, just a simple app to make typing more comfortable regardless of any score. It is built using vanilla Javascript and the [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API to generate random quotes.

## Features

1. Typing
2. Dark Mode
3. Auto next
4. Copy the quote
5. Reload

Here is the [live demo](https://rismawtsa.github.io/js-typing/)

## Running Locally

First, we must have the source code in our machine, to get it, open your favorite terminal and navigate to your preferred directory (eg. `cd desktop`) then run the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/rismawtsa/js-typing.git
```

or click the `code` button on the top right side of this repository to see the other options.

Then change the directory to `js-typing` and run the following command

```
npm install

npm start
```

You should see the output that looks very similar to this:

### Other commands

```
npm run build # build for production
npm run preview # locally preview production build
npm run deploy # deploy to github pages
```
