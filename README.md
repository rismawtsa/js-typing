# Js (Just) Typing

Just Typing is not a game, just a simple app to make typing practice more comfortable regardless of any score. It is built using vanilla Javascript and the [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) API to generate random quotes.

## Features

1. Typing
2. Dark Mode
3. Auto next
4. Copy the quote
5. Reload

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   Open the terminal, change the directory/folder to where you want to put it (eg. `cd ~/Documents/Projects/`) then run the following command

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rismawtsa/js-typing.git
   ```

   or click the `code` button on the top right side of this repository to see the other options.

2. Running the app
   Open the project on Visual Studio Code--make sure [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is installed. Right click the index.html file, and choose `Open with live server`.
